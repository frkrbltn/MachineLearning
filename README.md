# CSC 295 jupyternotebook Nine: Sports Car Price Models
## Description

In this jupyternotebook, we will be exploring and analyzing datasets related to Porsche and Jaguar sports cars. The main objective is to understand whether the value of these cars is influenced by their age and mileage. We will be loading and merging datasets, performing exploratory data analysis, and creating simple and multiple regression models.

We aim to form a predictive model equation for each car type and for the cars collectively. The models will be used to predict the prices for a 10-year-old car with 55,000 miles.

The jupyternotebook will involve the use of packages such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodels, and sklearn. The final part of the jupyternotebook will involve answering specific questions related to the correlation of mileage and age with the value of the cars, the predictive equations of our models, the best graphical visualization for our models, and the predicted values for a 10-year-old Porsche, Jaguar, and sports car with 55,000 miles.

The final submission will be a single Jupyter notebook, with all the code run and saved such that it does not have to be run again for grading.
